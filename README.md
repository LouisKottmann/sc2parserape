sc2parserape
============

The original parser was ported to .Net using Phalanger.

This project is part of Starcraft II Replay Monkey, a replay analyzer tool, available here: http://code.google.com/p/starcraft2replaymonkey/

Phalanger is no longer required to be installed for this application to run, 
however you DO need the Framework .Net 4.0 available 
[here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992&displaylang=en),
and VC++ 2010 SP runtime available [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84)

This application relies on Phalanger to call the PHP code from C#.
Phalanger is available [here](http://phalanger.codeplex.com/) but you don't have to install it.

The original parser is available [here (PHP)](https://code.google.com/p/phpsc2replay/)

If you're here for educational purpose (learning how to use Phalanger), 
I strongly recommand downloading the orignal PHP code and to check it against my modifications. Winmerge can help you do that.

*A Visual Studio 2010 project is now available in the [Download](https://code.google.com/p/sc2parserape/downloads/list) 
section of the google code page.*
